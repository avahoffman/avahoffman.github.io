<h2><a href="https://github.com/avahoffman/national-parks">National Park Service Data</a></h2>

Want to know when and how people visit National Parks? I built a custom Selenium scraper for National Park Service (NPS) visitation data. This code also uses the native NPS API to collect basic information about parks, including announcements and alerts (must have an API key!).
